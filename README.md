Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

`OPENAI_API_KEY` is required only for the AI image-generation functionality.

> ⚠️ **Never commit `.env` or API keys to GitHub.**

---

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## 💡 Example Usage

### 📄 Ask Questions About Documents

Upload a document and ask:

```text
Summarize this document.
```

```text
What methodology was used?
```

```text
What are the key findings?
```

```text
Explain this document in simple terms.
```

---

### 🌐 Perform Web Research

Ask questions such as:

```text
What are the latest developments in this technology?
```

If the required information is not available in the uploaded documents, the assistant can use web search.

---

### 🎙️ Use Voice Commands

You can interact with the assistant using voice commands:

```text
Open YouTube
Open Google
Open Gmail
Open GitHub
Open LinkedIn
Open Naukri
```

You can also ask document and research questions through voice.

---

### 💬 Use Chat Commands

The same website-opening functionality is available through text chat:

```text
Open YouTube
Open GitHub
Open Gmail
```

The assistant detects the command and opens the requested website.

---

## 📊 Document Analysis

The document analysis system can automatically identify and analyze different types of content.

Example workflow:

```text
Upload Document
       ↓
Document Classification
       ↓
Content Analysis
       ↓
Information Extraction
       ↓
AI Summarization
       ↓
Structured Analysis Report
       ↓
Download Report
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Data Storage

The application uses SQLite for authentication and local storage.

### User Database

```text
users.db
```

Stores:

* User accounts
* Hashed passwords
* Authentication/session information

### Conversation Storage

```text
conversations/
```

Stores user-specific conversation history.

Example:

```text
conversations/
│
├── user1/
│   ├── conversation_1.json
│   └── conversation_2.json
│
└── user2/
    └── conversation_1.json
```

---

## 🛡️ Security

The authentication system includes:

* PBKDF2-SHA256 password hashing
* Unique password salts
* Secure random session tokens
* Password validation
* Email validation
* Session expiration
* User-specific conversation storage
* Environment-based API credentials

For production deployment, additional security measures such as HTTPS, secure cookie configuration, CSRF protection, centralized secret management and production-grade authentication should be implemented.

---

## 📤 Conversation Export

Users can export their conversations for offline use.

Supported export formats include:

* PDF
* TXT

This allows users to save important research discussions and AI-generated responses.

---

## ⚙️ Groq LLM

The application uses Groq-hosted LLMs for fast AI responses.

Configured models include:

```text
llama-3.3-70b-versatile
llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

The model can be selected/configured depending on the task and API availability.

---

## 🗃️ FAISS Vector Store

FAISS is used for efficient semantic similarity search.

The process is:

```text
Documents
    ↓
Chunks
    ↓
Embeddings
    ↓
FAISS Index
    ↓
Similarity Search
    ↓
Relevant Context
```

This enables the assistant to retrieve the most relevant document content before generating an answer.

---

## 🔄 Query Routing Logic

The assistant can determine whether a query requires:

### 📄 Document Search

Used when the answer should come from uploaded documents.

```text
"What is the conclusion of this research paper?"
```

### 🌐 Web Search

Used when external/current information is required.

```text
"What are the latest developments in AI?"
```

### 🔄 Document + Web

Used when both uploaded content and external information are useful.

```text
"Compare the technology in my document with the latest developments."
```

### 🤖 Direct LLM

Used for general questions that don't require document or web retrieval.

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

### Missing API Key

Make sure your `.env` file contains:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

For image generation:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Restart Streamlit after modifying `.env`.

---

### Dependency Issues

Make sure the virtual environment is activated:

```bash
rag_env\Scripts\activate
```

Then reinstall dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Voice Assistant Issues

Ensure the required voice dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install faster-whisper rapidfuzz sounddevice
```

Additional system-level audio dependencies may be required depending on the operating system.

---

### FAISS / Vector Store Issues

If document retrieval is not working:

1. Restart the application.
2. Re-upload the documents.
3. Rebuild the vector store if required.
4. Check that the embedding dependencies are installed correctly.

---

## 🔮 Future Development

A separate backend architecture is also being developed to evolve this Streamlit application into a more scalable system.

Planned architecture:

```text
Frontend
   ↓
FastAPI Backend
   ↓
PostgreSQL
   ↓
pgvector
   ↓
RAG / AI Services
```

Potential improvements include:

* FastAPI backend
* PostgreSQL database
* SQLAlchemy
* Alembic migrations
* pgvector-based vector search
* Dedicated frontend
* Production-grade authentication
* Scalable deployment
* Improved document processing
* Advanced retrieval and reranking
